🧭 Phase 1 – Topic 1: Scrum Roles, Artifacts, and Events
Let’s start with the big picture question:
Why does Scrum define such specific roles, events, and artifacts instead of letting teams organize however they want?
(Take a moment to think about this — what problem do you think those formal elements are trying to solve?)
When you’re ready, we’ll explore:
Scrum Roles – who ensures value delivery and process transparency.
Scrum Artifacts – what represents the work and progress.
Scrum Events – when inspection and adaptation happen.


🌱 Let’s dive into Scrum Roles, the foundation of how a Scrum Team works together.
Before we break each one down, let’s begin with a guiding question:
💭 Why do you think Scrum limits the number of roles to just three? What might happen if a team adds more roles like “tester,” “architect,” or “analyst”?
(Take a second to think about that — Scrum’s simplicity here is intentional.)
🧩 Scrum Roles Overview
Scrum defines one team with three accountabilities:
Product Owner
Scrum Master
Developers
They’re not separate silos — they collaborate as one unit focused on one product goal.
👤 1. Product Owner (PO)
Purpose: Maximize the value of the product.
Main Responsibilities:
Manage the Product Backlog (what to build next).
Clearly communicate the Product Goal.
Prioritize items based on business value and feedback.
Ensure the team understands why items are valuable.
Common Misunderstanding:
The PO isn’t a “manager.” They don’t tell developers how to work — they clarify what and why.
Reflection Prompt:
How might a Product Owner’s prioritization choices affect flow and delivery speed when Kanban practices are added later?
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 2. Developers
Purpose: Create a usable Increment each Sprint.
Main Responsibilities:
Plan the Sprint Backlog.
Maintain quality and transparency.
Adapt plans during the Sprint to meet the Sprint Goal.
Common Misunderstanding:
In Scrum, “developer” means anyone doing product work — not just programmers. Designers, analysts, and testers are all developers if they contribute to the Increment.
Reflection Prompt:
How could WIP limits (from Kanban) help developers stay focused on completing an Increment each Sprint?
🧭 3. Scrum Master
Purpose: Ensure the team applies Scrum correctly and continuously improves.
Main Responsibilities:
Coach the team and organization in Scrum principles.
Remove impediments that slow delivery.
Facilitate Scrum events when needed.
Foster an environment of empiricism (transparency → inspection → adaptation).
Common Misunderstanding:
The Scrum Master is not a project manager or team boss. They are a servant-leader helping the team self-manage.
Reflection Prompt:
What challenges do you think a Scrum Master might face when balancing servant leadership with accountability for Scrum adoption?
✳️ Summary Thought
Scrum keeps roles minimal to reduce confusion and empower collaboration.
PO = Value
Developers = Quality
Scrum Master = Process
Together, they form one cohesive team focused on delivering usable increments each Sprint.




🧩
Let’s move on to Scrum Artifacts, the visible evidence of work and progress in a Scrum Team.
Before we break them down, here’s a reflection to get your mind working:
💭 Why do you think Scrum requires artifacts to be transparent to everyone, not just the developers or Product Owner?
(Hint: Think about empiricism — the Scrum value of making decisions based on what’s visible and known.)
📘 Scrum Artifacts Overview
Scrum defines three core artifacts, each tied to a commitment that ensures clarity and focus:
Artifact
Represents
Commitment
Product Backlog
All possible future work
Product Goal
Sprint Backlog
Work selected for this Sprint
Sprint Goal
Increment
The working product itself
Definition of Done (DoD)
Let’s explore each one.
🧭 1. Product Backlog
Purpose: A single, ordered list of everything needed for the product.
It’s dynamic — it evolves as the product and environment change.
Owned by: Product Owner (but visible to all).
Characteristics:
Ordered by value, risk, and necessity.
Each item (often a user story) should be clear enough to understand intent, not detail every step.
The top items are usually more detailed; lower ones are rough ideas.
Common Misunderstanding:
It’s not a “to-do list” for the entire company. It’s a strategic plan for what could make the product more valuable.
Reflection Prompt:
How might using Kanban flow metrics (like lead time) help the Product Owner reorder backlog items more effectively?
🧩 2. Sprint Backlog
Purpose: A plan created by developers during Sprint Planning that shows what they will deliver and how.
Owned by: Developers.
Includes:
The Sprint Goal (the “why”)
Selected Product Backlog items (the “what”)
A plan for delivering them (the “how”)
Characteristics:
Updated daily.
Provides transparency into current work.
Represents a forecast, not a fixed contract.
Common Misunderstanding:
It’s not a static commitment. The Sprint Backlog evolves as more is learned.
Reflection Prompt:
What might happen if WIP limits are ignored within the Sprint Backlog when using Kanban practices?
🚀 3. Increment
Purpose: The sum of all completed work that meets the Definition of Done (DoD).
It must be usable and add value, even if not yet released.
Owned by: The Scrum Team collectively.
Characteristics:
At least one Increment is created each Sprint.
Multiple increments can be created within a Sprint.
Transparency comes from a clear and shared Definition of Done.
Common Misunderstanding:
The Increment isn’t a prototype or a partial build — it must be potentially releasable.
Reflection Prompt:
How does focusing on small, frequent increments align with Kanban’s goal of continuous flow?
✳️ Summary Thought
Scrum Artifacts provide visibility and alignment at all times:
Product Backlog → What’s next
Sprint Backlog → What’s now
Increment → What’s done
Each artifact has a commitment that helps the team inspect and adapt effectively.






Now that you understand who does the work (roles) and what they produce (artifacts), let’s look at when and how the team inspects and adapts — through Scrum Events.
🕰️ Scrum Events Overview
Scrum is built on empiricism: decisions are made by observing what’s actually happening.
To make that possible, Scrum provides five events, each creating a regular moment for inspection, transparency, and adaptation.
Event
Purpose
When It Happens
Sprint
Container for all work
Continuous (time-boxed to 1 month or less)
Sprint Planning
Define Sprint Goal and plan work
Start of Sprint
Daily Scrum
Inspect progress, adapt plan
Every day
Sprint Review
Inspect Increment with stakeholders
End of Sprint
Sprint Retrospective
Inspect team process
After Review, before next Sprint
Let’s explore them in order.
🚀 1. The Sprint
Purpose: The heartbeat of Scrum — a fixed-length cycle for delivering value.
Time-box: 1 month or less (often 2 weeks).
Output: At least one usable Increment that meets the Definition of Done.
Important Rules:
No changes that endanger the Sprint Goal.
Scope can be clarified and negotiated as needed.
Each Sprint starts immediately after the previous one ends.
Common Misunderstanding:
The Sprint is not a mini-project. It’s a continuous cycle — inspect and adapt, again and again.
Reflection Prompt:
Why do you think having a consistent Sprint length helps teams establish flow when using Kanban principles later?
🧭 2. Sprint Planning
Purpose: Define a clear Sprint Goal and plan for delivering value.
Time-box: 8 hours max (for a 1-month Sprint).
Guiding Questions:
Why is this Sprint valuable? (→ Sprint Goal)
What can be done this Sprint? (→ Forecast)
How will the chosen work get done? (→ Plan)
Participants: Entire Scrum Team.
Common Misunderstanding:
Sprint Planning isn’t just a “task assignment” meeting — it’s a collaboration to align purpose and flow.
Reflection Prompt:
How might flow metrics like throughput or cycle time help a team forecast Sprint scope more realistically?
🔁 3. Daily Scrum
Purpose: Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the plan for the next 24 hours.
Time-box: 15 minutes.
Led by: Developers (not the Scrum Master).
Focus:
What did we complete since yesterday?
What are we focusing on next?
Are there any flow blockers or WIP issues?
Common Misunderstanding:
It’s not a status update to the Scrum Master — it’s a coordination tool for the developers.
Reflection Prompt:
How could a Kanban board help make the Daily Scrum more visual and focused on flow?
💬 4. Sprint Review
Purpose: Inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.
Time-box: 4 hours (for a 1-month Sprint).
Participants: Scrum Team + key stakeholders.
Focus:
What was completed in the Sprint?
What’s changed in the environment or market?
What should we do next?
Common Misunderstanding:
It’s not just a demo — it’s a working session to make data-informed decisions.
Reflection Prompt:
How could metrics like lead time or throughput enhance the discussion during Sprint Review?
🔄 5. Sprint Retrospective
Purpose: Inspect how the team worked and plan improvements.
Time-box: 3 hours (for a 1-month Sprint).
Focus:
What went well?
What could be improved?
What experiments will we try next Sprint?
Common Misunderstanding:
It’s not about blame — it’s about continuous improvement, just like Kanban’s focus on evolving processes.
Reflection Prompt:
How might a team use Kanban’s “visualizing work” principle to make their retrospectives more data-driven?
✳️ Summary Thought
Scrum Events create a rhythm of collaboration and reflection:
Sprint — the container
Planning — define the goal
Daily Scrum — inspect and adapt daily
Review — inspect the product
Retrospective — inspect the process
Kanban will later complement this rhythm by improving flow inside each event.
